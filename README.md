# call-implied-price-distribution-framework
This repository utilises a variety of Python libraries and packages to generate numerical solutions to the analysis done in the paper 'Probability distributions of future asset prices implied by option prices' by Bhupinder Bahra.
## Objectives
- Generate simple risk-free rate estimations for any defined timeframe by calculating an established SOFR-based discount factor based on the time to expiration of the options analysed.
- Generate the implied price distribution of a given asset using the Black-Scholes model and the methodology described by the aforementioned paper using sci-kit learn.
- Implement the mean-comparing strategy described in the paper to determine if it is able to generate accurate entry/exit signals for our established asset universe.
